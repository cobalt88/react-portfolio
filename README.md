2. All contributions are subject to peer review, so please keep your code clean and readable, feel free to comment as much as you like, however most of those comments will likely be removed in the final version if your contributions are merged. Your code should speak for itself wherever possible. 

3. If there is an open issue that is not assigned, that means it is available to be worked on, so take your pick.
